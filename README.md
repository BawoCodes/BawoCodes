 Hi, I’m @BawoCodes. A passionate self-taught Python developer and Data engineer.

I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. 
I am interested in Information Technology and Programming
I can work on projects with little or no supervision.
I am eager to learn new skills and I'm open to ideas.

Logic. Patience. Communication, and Attention to detail are my underlying strengths.
